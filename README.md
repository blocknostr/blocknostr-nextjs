# NOSTR X Clone

A simple Twitter/X-like social feed built with Next.js and NOSTR protocol integration.

## Features

- NOSTR login (via browser extension)
- Post messages to the public timeline
- View timeline of posts (demo: static, for now)
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

> For NOSTR login, install a NOSTR browser extension (e.g., nos2x, Alby).

## Next Steps

- Connect to real NOSTR relays for live timeline
- Add user profiles, likes, and replies
- Improve post composer and error handling
